# KitchnSpy

**KitchnSpy** is a data-first price tracking system built with FastAPI, MongoDB, and Celery.  
It scrapes selected KitchenAid products, logs historical price changes, and notifies subscribers via email when prices change or products are removed.

> *Built with caffeine and the desperate hope of justifying that gorgeous Evergreen Artisan mixer—or maybe the classic white tilt-head... or both?*
