*Building  with caffeine, and the desperate hope of finally justifying buying that gorgeous Evergreen Artisan mixer or maybe that classic white tilt-head... or both?*

## Okay, What's This about?

 I'm in the market for a KitchenAid tilt head stand mixer and mini food processor.

KitchnSpy uses a sophisticated digital network (just kidding, it's just BeautifulSoup) to scrape the KitchenAid UK website and track the prices of these beauties:

**Mixer Design Series 4.7L Evergreen Artisan (5KSM180WS)** - You'll understand my obsession if you know how gorgeous it is

**Mixer Tilt-Head 4.3L Classic White (5K45SS)** - Never goes out of style

**Glass Mixing Bowl 4.7 L (5KSM5GB)** - Because its transparent duh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**Mini Food Chopper 830ml White (5KFC3516)** - I have this in red, so I can't justify buying another one
